# Variable Scope: Lab

## Objectives

1. Use method arguments to pass values to a separate scope.
2. Write loops and conditionals with an awareness of scope.
3. Understand how variables go into and out of scope.

## Instructions

In this lab we're going to get some more practice writing code, but through the lens of scope. You'll have to navigate writing some methods that use loops and conditionals with the limitations of scope in mind.

1. Navagate to the `AppDelegate` file where you'll declare and define the following methods. Be sure and call the methods in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()` to check they work as intended.

2. Delcare and define the method body for `arrayByAddingString(_:string:)` which takes an array and a string as arguments. Have it return the array with the string added to it. 

3. Declare and define the method for `countOfUppercaseStringsInArray()` which takes an array as an argument and returns an unsigned integer of the count of the strings in the array that are all uppercase. 

4. Declare and define the method for `removeAllObjectsFromArray()`. This method should empty the argument array of its objects. Note how this method doesn't return anything.
